# Regex-Tutorial

## Description

This project is a comprehensive tutorial explaining a specific regular expression (regex). The purpose of this tutorial is to break down each component of the regex, making it easier for users to understand how the search pattern works and what each part of the expression does. My motivation behind this project is to help students and developers understand regex, a useful tool used for pattern matching and text searching. Regex is essential for developers to perform text manipulation efficiently. This tutorial serves as a guide for users to understand the search patterns defined by regex. This tutorial helps other developers understand the concept of regex by breaking it down with step-by-step explanations. In creating this tutorial, I gained a deeper understanding of regex.
